# PyKinect2

Enables writing Kinect applications, games, and experiences using Python.  Inspired by the original [PyKinect project on CodePlex](http://pytools.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=PyKinect).

Only color, depth, body and body index frames are supported in this version. 
PyKinectBodyGame is a sample game. It demonstrates how to use Kinect color and body frames.


## Prerequisites

The easiest way to get most of the pre-requisites is to use Anaconda which includes NumPy.  You'll then need to pip install comtypes.  The PyKinectBodyGame sample requires PyGame which needs to be manually installed.

1. Download [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) get the 32-bit version.  This includes NumPy.
2. pip install comtypes
3. Install the [Kinect for Windows SDK v2](http://aka.ms/k4wv2sdk)
